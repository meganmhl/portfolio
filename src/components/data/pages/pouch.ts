<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  International students in Australia face unique financial challenges, often relying on short-term, unsustainable
  budgeting strategies. Our research and interviews revealed that this approach leads to increased stress and poor
  financial habits. The Pouch project sought to address these pain points through a design thinking approach, resulting
  in a user-centric prototype focused on financial well-being.

<h3>Project Approach</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted interviews and surveys to understand user needs and financial
    behaviours.</li>
  <li><strong>Problem Definition:</strong> Mapped user journeys and identified key issues around budgeting, stress, and
    financial planning.</li>
  <li><strong>Ideation Workshops:</strong> Facilitated collaborative design thinking sessions to explore solutions and
    establish clear criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Developed a Figma-based interactive prototype for a user-friendly budgeting app.
  </li>
  <li><strong>User Testing:</strong> Ran usability sessions with international students to validate features and gather
    actionable feedback.</li>
</ul>
