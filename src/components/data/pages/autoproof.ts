<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  <strong>AutoProof</strong> is a blockchain-based proof-of-concept for secure, transparent vehicle history management.
  By leveraging Ethereum and NFT standards (ERC721), AutoProof enables persistent, auditable vehicle data—such as
  ownership, service records, and transfer events—directly on-chain. This modernizes legacy vehicle logbooks to reduce
  fraud and build trust among buyers and sellers, especially in the used vehicle market.
</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
  AutoProof employs a decentralized architecture with Ethereum blockchain as an immutable backend and a web-based DApp
  for user interaction. Vehicle records are issued as ERC721 NFTs that consolidate identification and provenance into
  tamper-resistant digital assets. All transactions use MetaMask wallet integration for authorization and execution.
</p>

<h4>Key Features &amp; Technologies</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>NFT-based Vehicle Registration:</strong> Each vehicle is represented by a unique ERC721 token.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralized Ownership and Service History:</strong> Ownership transfers and service events (maintenance,
    accidents, modifications) are recorded immutably on-chain via smart contracts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>End-to-End Transparency:</strong> All operations are open, auditable, and tamper-resistant.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Solidity (smart contracts), Hardhat (development), OpenZeppelin (contract
    library), Ethers.js (client interaction), MetaMask (wallet), Node.js &amp; Express.js (backend/API), HTML/CSS
    (frontend).
  </li>
</ul>
